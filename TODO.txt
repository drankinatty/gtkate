  * pending todos done

menu

  * adapt menu from gtkwrte, will need refactoring and many of the variables used will not be needed.

toolbar

  * incorporate toolbar from gtkwrite.

treeview/model

  * consider (app->treeview)[n] to allow multiple views for showing files grouped by directory, or sorted based on opening or ascending/descending alphabetical sort.

  * finish app->nuntitled logic. bit array with set/unset to replace current gint to handle save/close of "Untitled(n)" files.

multiview edit pane

  * decide whether to place focus in new instance of leave on current (present behavior).

  * set convenience pointer kinst.

  * decide whether to scroll new instance to match current insert mark.

buffer

  * adapt file open/save for document tree entries and check for buffer modified.

  * write file data out containing line, col and sourceview lang_id to restore view on file open. Use GFile and GHashtable to hash pointer to info to use in kinst_t instance initialization, replace contents of file on close, write serialized binary format similar to 'line col szfilenm szlangid filename lang_id' (4 int, 2 strings). Add to hashtable on open/save/close/close-all. remainder of kinst_t information can be derived from this.
