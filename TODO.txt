mainwin

  * remove all treeview / model create out of mainwin create and init view and model with "Untitled" before creating window. Create function to scan through names to append "Untitled(2)", etc..

menu

  * adapt menu from gtkwrte, will need refactoring and many of the variables used will not be needed.

toolbar

  * incorporate toolbar from gtkwrite.

buffer

  * adapt file open/save for document tree entries and check for buffer modified.

  * write file data out containing line, col and sourceview lang_id to restore view on file open. Use GFile and GHashtable to hash pointer to info to use in kinst_t instance initialization, replace contents of file on close, write serialized binary format similar to 'line col szfilenm szlangid filename lang_id' (4 int, 2 strings). Add to hashtable on open/save/close/close-all. remainder of kinst_t information can be derived from this.

  * rework app->view[0/1] approach to split window (note: current hardcoded values for testing)
